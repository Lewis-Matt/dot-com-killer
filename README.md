### Think Battleship™, only we are sinking tech startups like it is 2001.

    This is an exercise from Head First Java™ (HIGHLY recommend for any wannabe Java Jabronis [like myself]) chapters 5 and 6.
    
## The Jist
The computer is attempting to start a bunch of dot-com business's.  As a corporate take-over VP, it is your job to sink as many of their startups in the fewest number of tries (how else would we maintain our Monopoly status?). You will be rated based on your performance, and PIP'd (i.e. sacked) if you don't perform!

The computer will place 3 dot-coms on a 7x7 grid (no GUI, this is a a command-line application).
